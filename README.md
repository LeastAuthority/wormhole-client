# A magic-wormhole client in Haskell

`hwormhole` is a haskell version of Brian Warner's magic-wormhole file
transfer program (also called `wormhole`) that uses the wormhole protocol
also created by him. We use Jonathan Lange's MagicWormhole haskell library
to create this application that interoperates with the Python program that
Brian Warner provides.

This builds on jml's example application in the MagicWormhole library to
build a full fledged wormhole file transfer application.
